Getting It All Down
======================
January 5th, 2014
---------------------

For a couple of years now, maybe since finishing my last university paper a few years ago, I’ve been doing a fair bit of writing with no purpose beyond attaining some clarity of thought and keeping my brain active in the realm of abstract thinking. Travelling and moving around a fair bit I’ve also been lucky to make some great friends living all over the place and find myself always wishing I could keep in touch a bit more.

This blog is starting with the aim of sharing some of my stories and thoughts with the the people I’ve met along the way, both those I’ve known for years and those I’ve met in passing that would like to carry on the conversation. Untimely Quests, Timely Meditations is a flowery moniker for exactly the sort of things I’d like to share the most… updates from along the road, the big projects that end up making up life and the reflections that makes sense of past experiences and guide future ones.

Because I don’t imagine most of the people I know follow wordpress regularly I’ll post updates via twitter and facebook now and again.

Until then..
