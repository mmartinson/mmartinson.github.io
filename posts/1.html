    <h2 'id=title'>Are Drones the Perfect Target For Petty Vandalism?</h2>

    <p>2014 has seen an abundance of news concerning the expanding potential and reality of widespread drone usage. From hobby to package delivery to legal warrentless police surveillance, a brave new world of drone proliferation begins to seem inevitable. 
    </p>

    <p>With headlines of every new development there has come a wash of commentary, excitement and concern about how drone usage will affect the lives of North Americans. Reading through the projections, however, one can't help but notice a major issue that seems to be fairly undiscussed to the present. How will drone usage be challenged by both petty deliquents and conscious protestors and what will the companies, organizations and ultimately legislation and police actions do to combat that fact that valuable drones may be literally falling out of the sky at every corner? 
    </p>

    <p>One can imagine the circumstances fairly easy. Drones begin appearing fairly regularly in a mixed-use neighbourhood with deliveries to homes and small businesses. At first they are welcomed on account of their novelty and the excitement they bring as the science-fiction future becomes a little more real for the average comsumer. It won't be long, however, before their constant buzzing motors become a bit annyoing and someone gets the idea that stealing a package from a drone not only feels significantly more morally permissible than stealing one from a delivery person, it also presents a fairly exciting challenge. 
    </p>


    <p>Whether it's for such material gain or merely for senseless destruction (rememeber that as a bored teenager this can be an unusually exciting prospect), there will likely emerge a myriad of techniques for interfering with drone usage. The easiest I can image off the top of my head is shooting a drone with a slingshot while it's flying low overhead or landing on a neighbour's step. Sure, there will be <a href=http://goo.gl/yJqVr1>big data backed facial recogniton capabilities</a> for any drone user looking to protect his or her property. But how reliably effective is this and will it stand up as evidence for vandalism charges?
    </p>  
 
    <p>It is predicatable that in the beginning drone vandalism will receive a substantial amount of media coverage and in turn police response. But as the novely disappears it seems likely that vandalism responses may get demoted back to their currently enjoyed lower priority status and that protecting drones may become an implicit expense to the cost of doing business in the mid 21st century.
    </p>

    <p>The legal implcations of Amazon drone defense drones flying around the city tasing teenagers is a bit too far off to imagine at this moment. What's obvious though is that drone usage is going to present a sea of challenges to both legislators and law enforcent. The issue is <a href="http://goo.gl/olPUcH">already on the table in California</a> concerning the usage of police drones for home surveillance. Even after delivery drones show up en masse (at least outside of the SF Mission district) it may be a long time before they can operate as seamlessly as their owners would wish.
